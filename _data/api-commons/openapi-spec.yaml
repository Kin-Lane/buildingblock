    title: Building Block API
    description: When I started API Evangelist, I began tracking on the elements that
      other leading API providers use to operate their API programs, and eventually
      I started calling these building blocks. I keep a running list of building blocks,
      broken down into groups. I think use these to keep track of which building blocks
      companies are using. This is the API I use to manage these elements of everyday
      API operation.
